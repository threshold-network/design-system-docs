# Threshold Network Web3 Design System

This library is used by our team to build products with a consistent user experience.

When we first were deciding how we wanted to structure a design system, we evaluated several options to see what could be used for a web3 product. The web3 space has several components that are unique and important to the UX of the application, e.g. transaction modals and wallet interactions. No design system fully covered these use cases, so we decided to customize our own on top of an open source Chakra library.

If you use this in your product, we ask that you link back to this repo.

For the Figma library, you can duplicate the Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/zZi2fYDUjWEMPQJWAt8VWv/Threshold-DS?node-id=3436%3A24296).

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
* Compile important web3 components.
* Make a resource that was open source for the community.
* Document our research and thinking for these components.
* Create designs adn make changes across many files for any Threshold project faster.
* Ensure that designs are consistent across many designers and engineers.
