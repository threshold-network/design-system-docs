In **1 hour**, get the basics of Figma down! 

**How to use this file?**
This is intended as an async (or sync if you have a designer friend who can answer Q's) workshop. I will continue to test it out & improve it -- I've run it on a few folks so far. I would love your feedback in comments. 

This file is built on top of the default file that comes with a new Figma account! There are some more advanced tips in the version from Figma, so check that one out too.

Of course, some familiarity with using Illustrator, Canva, Photoshop, or other design software will definitely give you an edge. But, for this workshop, I put it together with a beginner in mind -- and baked in hot tips where I could.
