# Typography

The typography system is a foundation for readable and visually consistent communication. Use the following document as a guideline for laying out paragraphs and text in Threshold styles.

## Typeface

The typeface used for the Threshold logotype is Plaak Ney Heavy. The secondary typeface in branding and marketing is Inter.

The core brand font for Threshold products is **Inter**. 

This font is open source and freely available from Google Fonts here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter

## Guidelines

### Base Font

The Threshold type system is built on 8px scale, and the base font is 16px, or 1 em.

You will see that we show Threshold type in both em units and pixels.

An **Em** refers to the base text size. The value of 1 em means the same thing as a value of 100 percent of the base text size. The size of an Em or percent depends on its parent. If the base text size of body is 16 pixels, then 150% or 1.5 Em will be 24 pixels (1.5 * 16).

A **Pixel** (px) is browser dependent. It is the absolute size that you would see on your screen and is a static measurement.

### Font Color

Text will be difficult to read if it is too close to the background color. With accessible design in mind, we follow the WCAG standard. This maintains an AAA level of contrast ratio, i.e. 7:1 or more between the text and the background color.

*Make sure the typography has enough contrast with the background color.*

## Typography Styles

The following type styles are used in the Threshold system. Use heading styles for heading elements, body styles for body text, and button styles for buttons.

### Desktop and Tablet

*Use these header styles on mobile.*

## Marketing Alternates

Fonts in this category are for special use only, and not for typical Threshold product. Inter is the primary font and should be used the majority of the time so the look of our products and marketing materials are consistent.

However, we can create visual interest in some of our visuals by introducing some other fonts in things like POAPs, Twitter visuals, posters, or more experimental visuals.
