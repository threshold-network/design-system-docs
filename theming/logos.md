# Logos

The Threshold logo visually represents Threshold’s core principles: an emphasis on trustlessness, building in the open, decentralization, and bringing privacy to the public blockchain. 

In the mark, there is clear hints of a letter T shape, but the logo plays with the proportionality of the letter to shorten the leg of the T and elongate the arms. The result is a mark that is balanced on all sides and unique and ownable.

The overlapping layers create a dynamic logo that looks striking in sizes large and small. The logo is constructed from many pixel blocks, just like our network is built up of many nodes.

The Threshold logo was designed by Moniker: https://monikersf.com/
