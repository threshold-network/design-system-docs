# Atoms

**Atoms** in the design system are the basic building blocks of the UI and the most simple form. They canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional. For example - buttons, dividers, and badges. 

To learn more about using atomic design systems, refer to this section of Brad Frost's book _Atomic Design_: https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/
