# Cards

The card is a background element that holds some data. It lays over top of the background of the screen. Use this to contain information.

## Guidelines

### Basic Card
The card comes in two basic varieties. The one on the left is used for multiple cards on a page, that are each not the primary focus. The one on the right is used for when there is a card that is the primary focal element.
